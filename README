Installation : Firefox Extension (FFInterface.xpi)
==================================================

1. Open Mozilla Firefox.
2. Click File -> Open File -> FFInterface.xpi
3. Click Install Now.
4. A browser restart is required.
5. After browser is restarted, you'll see FFInterface in the newly installed addons list.

   You can change the port, you can enable/disable AutoStart and you can Start/Stop the listening.


Working
=======

1. After FFInterface addon is installed, open firefox, make sure the extension is running. (Tools -> FFInterface), if its "Stop FFInterface", means FFInterface is already running.

2. Open FFInterface.exe

3. Click Connect.

4. The text specified in Send Textbox is sent to firefox and the text received from firefox is displayed in Received textbox.

5. Now, open "TestPage.html" (included) in currently running firefox window.

6. In the Name textbox on TestPage, enter some text.

7. Now switch to FFInterface.exe utility, in its send textbox,enter : "gi|N1" (without quotes). Click Send.

8. In the Received textbox, you'll see the text entered in Name textbox on TestPage.

9. "gi" specifies getElementById and "gn" specifies getElementsByName. "|" is used as a delimiter. The second argument after delimiter should be ElementId or ElementName for gi and gn respectively.

Example:-
gi|N1
gn|Name1
gi|G11|Checked
gn|Gen1 


10. To set a specific element on the page open inside firefox, the format is "s|<javascript>"

Example:-
s|document.F.N1.value='blah'
s|document.F.G11.checked=true
s|document.F.Sub1.Click();


Here, F is the Formname, N1 is ElementId for Name Textbox, G11 is ElementId for Male Radiobutton, Sub1 is the name of the Submit button.

11. I've also added a feature to send raw string as URL. So, you can send a string say "www.google.com", to open google. Or you can send any javascript, which will get interpreted inside the browser.
